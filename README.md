# PyBer_Analysis

## Analyzing Summary DataFrame
The Pyber summary is categorized by three city types: Urban, suburban, and rural; the summary reflects that the result of the Total Numnber of Rides & Drivers, and Total Fares are in the following order: Urban > Suburban > Rural. And the Average Fare per Ride & Average Fare per Drive resulted in following order: Rural > Suburban > Urban. The data from the summary implies that the average fare (for both per ride & driver) tends to become high if there are fewer number of the drivers and and rides. 

## Analyzing the multiple-line graph 
First of all, the graph reflects the totral fare by city type and just like the information(data) from the summary, the graph also depicts the city type Urban is earning the highest total fare, then suburban followed the next, and rural lastly. Unlike the summary, the graph shows us more than just numbers; we can overview the tendency of fare($USD) each city type is earning for the specific period we've set ['2019-01-01':'2019-04-28']. Commonly, the fare of all three city types are tend to recover their slightly dropped total fare from the mid of Feburary and dropped again in March and so on. Although the rates of ups and downs are different, their pattern/ tendency of the total fare through the months are responsive alongside.
